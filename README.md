# PsychoPysics

PsychoPysics [1], is a set of PsychoPy [2] experiments and Excel spreadsheets for teaching psychophysics. The current set includes experiments that implement standard threshold methods (adjustment, limits, constant stimuli), theory of signal detection, and scaling methods (rating, pair comparison, magnitude estimation).
